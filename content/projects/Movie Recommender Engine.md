üçø A DIY JAVA recommender engine for movies [GUI+Web App]

The goal of the project is to recommend movies based on different criteria which is further based on user ratings of those movies.

The idea was inspired by the website ‚Äútwitflicks.com‚Äù which used to mine Twitter for current movies related tweets.
