üõéÔ∏è Home Automation Tools using NodeMCU-ESP8266 featuring realtime notifications about door lock/unlock status.

This project is about different home automation features that you can implement using ESP8266 Module paired with Firebase and Google Assistant. As an example, I have implemented a door unlock demo in this project. The aim is to alert the user when the doorbell rings and enable him/her to unlock the door using Google Assisstant. The project can be further developed to include Google Home integration, IFTTT, or whatever your heart may desire.
